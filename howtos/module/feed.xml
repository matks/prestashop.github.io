      <description>PrestaShop has been around for many years, during which thousands of modules were made by thousands of developers, yet we still see the same simple mistakes being made, even though they could easily be avoided.
Here is a list of 10+ common mistakes when coding a PrestaShop module, with a short information on how to avoid them.

      <description>PrestaShop has numerous features in the API, both hidden in its code as well as in the developer documentation and there are many tools that allow you to create your own module in no time! Unfortunately I have noticed that many developers do not use these features and tools to their advantage, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to change all that :) Hopefully, these tips will increase your development speed and save you lots and lots of time.</description>

      <title>How to override modules in PrestaShop</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/howtos/module/how-to-override-modules/</link>

      <description>This article may be outdated Please note that this article refers to very old versions of PrestaShop. Check out the documentation to learn how to override modules. Since version 1.6.0.11 of PrestaShop, there is a new feature that allows developers to override a module&amp;rsquo;s instance classes (ie. its main module files, see the PR by @axometeam).
Since PrestaShop uses lots of modules for both core and custom features, module overrides are a welcome addition to an already great override system in PrestaShop.</description>
