      <description>According to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a bug is an &amp;ldquo;event that is not part of the standard operation of a service and causes an unplanned interruption or decrease the quality of service&amp;rdquo;. And it is everybodyâ€™s job to chase them all!
At the PrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA), we browse issues on GitHub all day long. As we go about doing that, we often come across messages from people who are annoyed about a bug taking a long time to be fixed, and saying &amp;ldquo;this is a major issue, why is it still not fixed?</description>
