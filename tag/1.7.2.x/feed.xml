      <description>A small line might have gone unnoticed in the PrestaShop 1.7.2.2 release announcement: &amp;ldquo;1.7 front-end should now be faster than 1.6’s for popular stores&amp;rdquo;. What does it apply to, and how did we test for such performances? Here&amp;rsquo;s how.
With the release of PrestaShop 1.7.2.2, we have tried to remove a few point of contention which were affecting badly overall PrestaShop performance:
Specific price computation Bad sale page pagination, which loaded too many products on one page Let&amp;rsquo;s check the specific price improvement!</description>

      <description>If you follow the Core Weekly or our recent GitHub activity, you may have seen that we introduced a new front-end technology in the PrestaShop back office: Vue.js. So, let’s talk a little about it to see what’s coming up.
Vue.JS késako? As it describes itself, &amp;ldquo;Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.&amp;rdquo; It is component-driven, meaning that you have one file per component (=html element). You can create your own components, as many as you want.</description>

      <title>Stock management in PrestaShop 1.7 - part 3</title>

      <description>In the previous episodes, we’ve seen the motivations for designing a new stock management interface and how we’ve built it. By now, you must be pretty eager to see what it looks like for real… So let’s dive into the features of this new page of PrestaShop 1.7.2.0.
How do you get started? From the back-office left menu, just click on Catalog / Stock. That’s it!
No need to activate an “advanced stock management” option from an obscure configuration page, nor to create a warehouse and then assign products to a warehouse and then assign every product to this stock management system… You see the point: contrary to PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <description>In a previous article, we’ve explained the reasons why we’re rebuilding the stock management system in 1.7. We detailed the initial brief of this project: the context, our intentions, what was out-of-scope and the expected outcome. In this article, I want to dive into our methodologies and the main steps of this project.
Remember this diagram?
It outlines the workflow of product management, design and development we’ve put into practice to ship a new major feature.</description>

      <description>In late 2016, the PrestaShop product team took a challenging decision: rebuild the stock management system of PrestaShop 1.7. At the origins of this project was a thorough investigation and a truth-facing moment.
To present the project’s outline, I’ll use a framework called “Auftragsklärung” (German for “Clarification Briefing”) created by Xing, itself inspired by “The Art of Action” by Stephen Bungay. This is an exercise we’ve put into practice in the product team: it helped us align the understanding and goals of various stakeholders in top management, developers, designers, and other business units.</description>
