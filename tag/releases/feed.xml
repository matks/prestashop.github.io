      <description>Now that PrestaShop 8.0 is out, here is a focus on maintained branches of the PrestaShop project and what to expect.
Reminder: PrestaShop branching strategy In August 2015 PrestaShop adopted a new branching model for the project.
The model was refined over the years, for example with this page on the developer documentation about what bugs do qualify for a patch version or the Backward Compatibility Promise that defines what changes can be introduced in a version, but we can say the model has lived quite well as the project is still following it in 2023.</description>

A significant cleanup has been performed in the codebase, with several internal components updated, modified or removed. PrestaShop 8 is also the projectâ€™s first company-neutral release, meaning that it no longer includes commercial products and services built-in.</description>
