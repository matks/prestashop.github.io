      <description>Working on an open source project as massive as the PrestaShop codebase, a few ground rules have long been established in order to ease the participation of developers, be they from the PrestaShop Core team or the Community at large.
For long, we used our own coding standards. We then switched to PSR-2 last year.
Because we want to have an always better codebase, clearer, easier to read and to maintain, we have decided to follow some more established standards for the languages used in PrestaShop.</description>

      <description>We are planning to switch to PSR-2, here is the why, the how and the when!
The current situation PrestaShop currently uses its own Coding Standards, based on PSR-1, with a few adaptations for historical reasons.
For a long time, we&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to move to a more generally-accepted coding standard. PrestaShop is loved by its community and we love our community, and we wanted to adopt a common coding standard in order to ease code contribution.</description>
