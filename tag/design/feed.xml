      <description>As announced here, the Core product team recently adopted a new working tool to gather feedback and prioritize features: Productboard. No more teasing, it is now time to have a look at how it will look and how we will all be able to handle it!
Productboard makes two things possible for the team:
On the one hand, having a dedicated internal interface to centralize all feedback, group them into topics, define features, and prioritize them.</description>

      <description>In March 2020, the Core product team at PrestaShop, in charge of building and prioritizing new features, decided to work with a new tool: Productboard.
The team thought it was the right occasion to talk more about the product development at PrestaShop, the steps, the roles and responsibilities and what happens behind the scenes before a new feature is added to PrestaShop.
PrestaShop’s product development cycle Core product team In the PrestaShop company, a cross-functional team is dedicated to maintaining the PrestaShop open source project: the Core team.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop is 10 years old this year. 10 years and a software that have experienced 7 major evolutions.
Over the years, the core of the software has added many features, serving both small and large merchants.
With 10 years of development behind us, a general observation is that PrestaShop offers a flexible software, rich of hundreds features, but this richness has, over the years and evolutions, brought graphical inconsistencies. Also, it is difficult for contributors to design modules which are perfectly aligned with our branding, because our product design guidelines have evolved while not being documented enough.</description>

      <description>As a designer, product manager or entrepreneur you’ve probably been told countless times that user feedback is gold (and that’s true!). There’s no shortage of books and articles that describe the benefits of testing your product with your users. While these documents provide good advice on how the test is done, they often lack explanations on how to make sense of this feedback and how this process fits inside a team.</description>

      <description>When merchants use PrestaShop for the first time, they’re offered a basic shop with demo products and a default theme. This basic theme is essential for the merchants to have a clear insight of what their new shop will look like. For the 1.7 version of the software, we’ve decided to revamp this default theme which we called “Classic”.
Main goals of the Classic theme With around 600 free native features, PrestaShop is the ideal software for anyone wishing to get started with e-commerce.</description>
