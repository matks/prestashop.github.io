      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great feedback since the release of version 1.6.1.0 of PrestaShop. We are very happy to see that issues seem to be few, non-critical and fixable.
That being said, there are still issues here and there, and while the team is already at work on the next major version, we do not want to keep you waiting for fixes that might be important to you. Hence, we have decided to work on a patch version for PrestaShop 1.</description>
