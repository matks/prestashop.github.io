      <description>As announced here, the Core product team recently adopted a new working tool to gather feedback and prioritize features: Productboard. No more teasing, it is now time to have a look at how it will look and how we will all be able to handle it!
Productboard makes two things possible for the team:
On the one hand, having a dedicated internal interface to centralize all feedback, group them into topics, define features, and prioritize them.</description>

      <description>In March 2020, the Core product team at PrestaShop, in charge of building and prioritizing new features, decided to work with a new tool: Productboard.
The team thought it was the right occasion to talk more about the product development at PrestaShop, the steps, the roles and responsibilities and what happens behind the scenes before a new feature is added to PrestaShop.

      <description>It is always great to see contributions from our community merged, it reminds the power of working on an open-source project. Especially when there are great features at stake, like the fuzzy search.
In this case, we are talking about the Levenshtein algorithm. It should be available in version 1.7.7 thanks to Lathanao and it will definitely improve both the user experience and the conversion rate on your site! Wow, but what is it?</description>

      <description>In the previous posts, we spoke about our motivations for designing a new stock management system and how we’ve built it in the 1.7.2 release. We also described in depth the features and the technology used in these new interfaces. Now it’s time to tell you about the forthcoming advanced features of stock management!

      <description>In the previous episodes, we’ve seen the motivations for designing a new stock management interface and how we’ve built it. By now, you must be pretty eager to see what it looks like for real… So let’s dive into the features of this new page of PrestaShop 1.7.2.0.
How do you get started? From the back-office left menu, just click on Catalog / Stock. That’s it!
No need to activate an “advanced stock management” option from an obscure configuration page, nor to create a warehouse and then assign products to a warehouse and then assign every product to this stock management system… You see the point: contrary to PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <description>In a previous article, we’ve explained the reasons why we’re rebuilding the stock management system in 1.7. We detailed the initial brief of this project: the context, our intentions, what was out-of-scope and the expected outcome. In this article, I want to dive into our methodologies and the main steps of this project.
Remember this diagram?
It outlines the workflow of product management, design and development we’ve put into practice to ship a new major feature.</description>

      <description>In late 2016, the PrestaShop product team took a challenging decision: rebuild the stock management system of PrestaShop 1.7. At the origins of this project was a thorough investigation and a truth-facing moment.
To present the project’s outline, I’ll use a framework called “Auftragsklärung” (German for “Clarification Briefing”) created by Xing, itself inspired by “The Art of Action” by Stephen Bungay. This is an exercise we’ve put into practice in the product team: it helped us align the understanding and goals of various stakeholders in top management, developers, designers, and other business units.</description>

      <title>Presenting the Advanced EU Compliance module</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2015/advanced-eu-compliance/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2015/advanced-eu-compliance/</guid>
      <description>As good news never come alone, let us introduce you to the new module that is included natively in PrestaShop from 1.6.1.0 version: Advanced EU Compliance.
Why did we create this module? E-commerce evolves at a very fast pace, and the more it evolves the more new legislations are appearing to frame it. These legislations can - over time - become a real headache for e-shop owners, who have to adapt their website themselves, or to hire someone to do it for them.</description>
