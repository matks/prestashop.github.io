      <description>Have you submitted code to PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s Core codebase or any of its native module through a pull request on GitHub? Then read on!
The PrestaShop team has four main ways to get feedback from the Community:
The Support Forums, where we try to answer the most pressing matters (and there&amp;rsquo;s never enough hours in the day). The Forge, our bugtracker, where users (both developers and merchants) report issues or suggest improvements, and the team handles them one by one, according to their complexity and impact.</description>
