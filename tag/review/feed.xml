      <description>The Build devblog was started in March 2015 (and officially launched on April 3rd), as a way for the devteam to let the PrestaShop Community know about the things that we were planning. We wanted to communicate directly with the technical minds in the Community, and out of this want, this blog was born!
At first only filled with the Core Weekly reports, which were at the time published on the forums, the Build blog now shares news about the PrestaShop product, tools for contributing, and regular updates.</description>
