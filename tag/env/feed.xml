      <description>Any open source project comes with its own set of rules to harmonize everybody&amp;rsquo;s contributions. Usually the guidelines are described in a CONTRIBUTING.md file inside the project root directory.
To follow these guidelines, you often need to adapt your development environment. You will find here all you need to know to set up your development environment! This will help your contribution get validated more quickly and without further modifications.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about working with the PrestaShop project, but what you&amp;rsquo;ll read here applies to most PHP open source projects.</description>
