      <description>Open source has its own tradition when fall starts cooling the atmosphere around, Hacktoberfest! Beer is not flowing like water but code is, and it creates more value than any bunch of slightly tipsy people. ;-)
Curated by the American cloud hosting company DigitalOcean, with Intel and DEV, Hacktoberfest happens online every year in October to celebrate open source. Itâ€™s pretty simple: for one month, people are encouraged to engage and create at least 4 pull requests for open source projects on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Contribution is not only about code. As an open source project, everyone is encouraged to participate in the construction of PrestaShop: you can translate the software in your native language, suggest a new feature, sign up to the User Club and share your experience with the product teams, become an ambassador&amp;hellip; and also write specifications!
Hosted on a dedicated GitHub repository, product specifications are meant to formally describe how features should work on a given page.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop is a successful Open Source project â€“ with more than 300 000 shops worldwide, merchants trust us to help them build their ecommerce shop.
However this success has a cost: every day our users discover new bugs and inconsistencies in the project, and they come to GitHub to report them. On average, 10 new issues are created every day on GitHub (counting bug reports and feedback about features), and 2 out of 3 issues are either invalid or duplicates.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, the PrestaShop product team decided to use new leverage to help new contributors participate in the PrestaShop project on GitHub: the &amp;lsquo;good first issue&amp;rsquo; label.
But what is it exactly? And how does it work? Below are some questions raised to give it a proper definition and specify its use:
ðŸ¤” What does this label mean? People participating in the PrestaShop project do not have the same purpose, they also do not share the same skills.</description>

      <description>Have you submitted code to PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s Core codebase or any of its native module through a pull request on GitHub? Then read on!
The PrestaShop team has four main ways to get feedback from the Community:
The Support Forums, where we try to answer the most pressing matters (and there&amp;rsquo;s never enough hours in the day). The Forge, our bugtracker, where users (both developers and merchants) report issues or suggest improvements, and the team handles them one by one, according to their complexity and impact.</description>

      <title>Set up your Git for contributing</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/howtos/misc/set-up-your-git-for-contributing/</link>

      <description>Any open source project comes with its own set of rules to harmonize everybody&amp;rsquo;s contributions. Usually the guidelines are described in a CONTRIBUTING.md file inside the project root directory.
To follow these guidelines, you often need to adapt your development environment. You will find here all you need to know to set up your development environment! This will help your contribution get validated more quickly and without further modifications.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about working with the PrestaShop project, but what you&amp;rsquo;ll read here applies to most PHP open source projects.</description>
