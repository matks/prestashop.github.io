      <description>A lot of work has been done on the new back office for PrestaShop 1.7, most notably the reworked Product page and Modules page; as well as the brand new theme. Now, we need you to tell us what you think &amp;ndash; face to face! As a reminder, the PrestaShop 1.7 Project FAQ is available.
A big part of the PrestaShop 1.7 project was making sure that this new version had a design that would help merchants do their daily tasks faster and with less confusion.</description>
