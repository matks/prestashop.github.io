      <description>The first Beta version for PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 is now ready for you to test!
We are happy to announce that we are close to releasing 1.7.5.0. This minor version (in the SemVer meaning of the term) brings important new features and improvements to the 1.7 codebase, and we canâ€™t wait to receive your feedback!
This Beta release is a great opportunity for you to start working with it before we release a stable version.</description>
