      <description>PrestaShop is a successful Open Source project â€“ with more than 300 000 shops worldwide, merchants trust us to help them build their ecommerce shop.
However this success has a cost: every day our users discover new bugs and inconsistencies in the project, and they come to GitHub to report them. On average, 10 new issues are created every day on GitHub (counting bug reports and feedback about features), and 2 out of 3 issues are either invalid or duplicates.</description>
