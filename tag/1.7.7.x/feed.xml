Major issues on the product page The issue #25718 and #25753 appeared due to the implementation of the numeric data format for number fields on the 1.7.7.6 patch version. This regression prevents users to edit the impact of a combination and causes rounding problems on the impact calculation.</description>

      <description>The second Beta version for PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 is now ready for you to test!
Over 130 Pull Requests have been merged since the first Beta of 1.7.7.0 was released about three months ago. A great number of regressions have been detected and fixed thanks to extensive testing by the community and the PrestaShop team, mainly in the new order pages. However, as new regressions keep being reported, the maintainer team has decided to issue a second Beta release before a Release Candidate is built.</description>

      <description>It is always great to see contributions from our community merged, it reminds the power of working on an open-source project. Especially when there are great features at stake, like the fuzzy search.
In this case, we are talking about the Levenshtein algorithm. It should be available in version 1.7.7 thanks to Lathanao and it will definitely improve both the user experience and the conversion rate on your site! Wow, but what is it?</description>
