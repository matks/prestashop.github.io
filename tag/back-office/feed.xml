      <description>PrestaShop is 10 years old this year. 10 years and a software that have experienced 7 major evolutions.
Over the years, the core of the software has added many features, serving both small and large merchants.
With 10 years of development behind us, a general observation is that PrestaShop offers a flexible software, rich of hundreds features, but this richness has, over the years and evolutions, brought graphical inconsistencies. Also, it is difficult for contributors to design modules which are perfectly aligned with our branding, because our product design guidelines have evolved while not being documented enough.</description>
