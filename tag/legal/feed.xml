      <description>As good news never come alone, let us introduce you to the new module that is included natively in PrestaShop from 1.6.1.0 version: Advanced EU Compliance.
Why did we create this module? E-commerce evolves at a very fast pace, and the more it evolves the more new legislations are appearing to frame it. These legislations can - over time - become a real headache for e-shop owners, who have to adapt their website themselves, or to hire someone to do it for them.</description>
