      <description>Our core team worked closely in the past few months with the Microsoft Azure Team to build 4 ready-to-use PrestaShop cloud hosting plans. Youâ€™re invited to discover an exclusive preview of it in Paris next week!
From standalone virtual machines to multi-VMs solutions, these 4 offers have been built to help you be more adaptable and scalable. They include powerful tools and services, such as high availability, SQL clusters and load balancers with auto-scaling web servers just to name a few.</description>
