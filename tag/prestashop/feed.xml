      <description>Thatâ€™s official, there will be a dedicated space for developers at the PSD Paris 2019. If you are developing themes and modules or contributing to the core, this is the place to be the 4th of June 2019.
Having such a place was expected by many people in the community. There was no dedicated space last year: that was possible to speak standing, exchange, but not possible to work. But this year, we do!</description>
