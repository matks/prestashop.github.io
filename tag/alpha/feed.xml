      <description>Three weeks ago we released PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 alpha 3. Since then, and with the help of the community, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on it to fix the bugs you&amp;rsquo;ve reported and to keep improving this new version. We&amp;rsquo;re now releasing PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 alpha 4 version, so we can keep gathering feedback and make sure that the final and stable version will be the best it can be!
While this alpha version is not ready for production stores, it is a great basis for us to get your feedbacks.</description>
