      <description>Even if your back office is already secured by PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s login, you might want to add another layer of security from your webserver itself. This is done using the htaccess.txt and htpasswd.txt files. After you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded them at the root of the folder to secure (in our case, your back office folder), the server will ask you for a username and a password before you can even access your PrestaShop back office login page.</description>
