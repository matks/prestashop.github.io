      <description>With the adoption of SemVer-like versioning, we know that a patch version will only feature non-breaking changes, making it far safer to update to PrestaShop than ever before&amp;hellip; and thus safer for us to release patch version more regularly.
As a reminder, this is how SemVer works:
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</description>

      <description>We are planning to switch to PSR-2, here is the why, the how and the when!
The current situation PrestaShop currently uses its own Coding Standards, based on PSR-1, with a few adaptations for historical reasons.
For a long time, we&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to move to a more generally-accepted coding standard. PrestaShop is loved by its community and we love our community, and we wanted to adopt a common coding standard in order to ease code contribution.</description>
