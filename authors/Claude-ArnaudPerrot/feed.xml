      <description>In this third article in the performance series we started last year, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about PHP, scalability and its impact on the filesystem!
Also, we&amp;rsquo;re glad to announce that our White Paper about PrestaShop Performance is now published. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested by performance in general and PrestaShop in particular, have a look at it and let us know what you think!
Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into PHP, filetystem and scalability!</description>

      <title>Apache vs. NGINX: Match of the Millennium</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/apache-vs-nginx/</link>

      <description>Here is the second article in the performance series we started last year, dealing with the old feud between Apache and NGINX.
As you may have heard of, we will soon publish a White Paper about PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s performances, how to tune your shop, enhance its response time, and so on.
During these benchmarks, we did compare performances between Apache &amp;amp; NGINX, the usual contenders, with identical setups.
Though this article probably won&amp;rsquo;t end the long debate between those two, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it will help you find some clarity on the matter and find out which one is best suited for your configuration.</description>

      <title>Performance (&amp; PrestaShop)</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2020/performance-and-prestashop/</link>

      <description>Introducing a new series of article to talk about performance, benchmarking and PrestaShop!
You may have heard of it, but we&amp;rsquo;ll soon release a White Paper, which is all about PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s performance, how to benchmark it and how it behaves under loads. And what to do to keep it responding under 300ms.
Still, there are a number of matters that can&amp;rsquo;t be covered in a White Paper - hopefully the first in a series, fingers crossed.</description>
