      <description>Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it&amp;rsquo;s also about taking part in the PrestaShop translation project! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in April.
Project news First news, a way to boost translations ðŸ”¥ As I mentioned in the previous Crowdin Monthly, many PrestaShop translation projects, such as Esperanto, are reaching higher translation rates thanks to dedicated contributors. To help and encourage them, I did some tests by translating strings with Crowdinâ€™s Pre-translation via Translation Memory (TM) tool.</description>
