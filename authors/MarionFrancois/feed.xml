      <description>With the release of the new version 1.7.8 which is in progress, this article details one of the main features revamps of this version: the multistore.
The multistore feature allows merchants to manage several front offices through a single back office. Itâ€™s frequently used by merchants who sell in different countries and therefore have different languages and/or currencies. It is also used by merchants who do both B2B and B2C. And it is more rarely used by merchants who have several brands.</description>

      <description>The core product team is currently carrying out a survey oriented around the open-source project for the community.
You are many to express yourself on Slack, on the forum, or on Github about your pains and your wishes about the open-source project.
A lot of issues and suggestions are reported to the project every week. The maintainerâ€™s team&amp;rsquo;s resources are limited, and itâ€™s not possible to integrate all feedbacks experienced by all users.</description>

      <title>Introducing a new bug severity classification</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2019/severity-classification/</link>

      <description>According to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a bug is an &amp;ldquo;event that is not part of the standard operation of a service and causes an unplanned interruption or decrease the quality of service&amp;rdquo;. And it is everybodyâ€™s job to chase them all!
At the PrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA), we browse issues on GitHub all day long. As we go about doing that, we often come across messages from people who are annoyed about a bug taking a long time to be fixed, and saying &amp;ldquo;this is a major issue, why is it still not fixed?</description>
