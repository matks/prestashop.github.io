      <description>PrestaShop has numerous features in the API, both hidden in its code as well as in the developer documentation and there are many tools that allow you to create your own module in no time! Unfortunately I have noticed that many developers do not use these features and tools to their advantage, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to change all that :) Hopefully, these tips will increase your development speed and save you lots and lots of time.</description>
