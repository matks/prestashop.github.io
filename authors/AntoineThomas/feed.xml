      <description>This year, for the first time, a Call for Papers was organised for a PrestaShop event. The objective was to give a voice to the community and learn from its active members. Let&amp;rsquo;s make a quick tour of the results.
Because it&amp;rsquo;s 2020 Launched during Spring with a Google Form, the Call for Papers was originally targeted for PrestaShop Day Paris 2020, scheduled to take place last June. Unfortunately, due to the health crisis, this event was canceled, like all other in-person events.</description>

This article is about quick wins, upcoming developments, and about the general spirit behind this work.

      <description>This last year, the PS company has been facing a dilemma: how to dedicate 100% of the developers’ time to move forward faster on the 1.7 version of the open source project, something everybody agrees on. And, at the same time, provide more time for merchants still using the 1.6 version to get ready to upgrade, by keeping them safe in case of critical issue after the official support ends on the 30th of June 2019.</description>
