      <description>No matter how well designed is your project and how many tests you have, at some point your website can become inaccessible.
And this because of your database, or calls to third-party services that are unavailable (e.g: payment methods API, PrestaShop REST API to retrieve modules information, synchronization with an ERP, automatization of warehouse &amp;amp; logistic, etc.).
Instead of thinking everything will be ok, we - as developers - need to manage our systems&amp;rsquo; failures.</description>

      <description>Since the release of 1.7.0, we are working hard on improving the way developers can customize and enhancing the quality of PrestaShop.
An extra theme system has been integrated that introduces new helpers, widgets and inheritance scheme between templates. It&amp;rsquo;s now easier for everyone to create new themes with PrestaShop, especially for those who are more designers than developers.
We have also started the migration of the back office with the framework Symfony 2, first with the Product and Modules pages and then with the Translation and Stock Management pages.</description>

      <description>Three weeks ago we released PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 alpha 3. Since then, and with the help of the community, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on it to fix the bugs you&amp;rsquo;ve reported and to keep improving this new version. We&amp;rsquo;re now releasing PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 alpha 4 version, so we can keep gathering feedback and make sure that the final and stable version will be the best it can be!
While this alpha version is not ready for production stores, it is a great basis for us to get your feedbacks.</description>
