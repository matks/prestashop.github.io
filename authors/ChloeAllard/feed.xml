      <description>You are a developer, you love PrestaShop and are passionate about open source? Maybe you are even already a contributor to our project? Then what are you waiting for, letâ€™s work together!
We are looking for people focused on producing quality code, meaning it should be readable, maintainable, tested and documented.
As Prestashop is an open source project, you will be responsible for:
Reviewing your colleagues or contributors code; Giving advice and providing constructive criticism; Participating in many discussions, whether on GitHub, Slack or Gitter; Fixing bugs without introducing new ones; In order to maintain its technical leadership, PrestaShop makes sure its developers devote time to training and sharing their knowledge with their colleagues.</description>
