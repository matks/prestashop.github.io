      <description>An open source community is more than just pull requests made by faceless strangers. In order to better understand the people who contribute time and skills to the PrestaShop project, we&amp;rsquo;re writing a series of interviews with contributors of all ranges. This week, meet Pululu Kinanga AndrÃ©, one of our great developers on GitHub!
Hi Pululu! First, could you tell us a bit about yourself?
I am Pululu and I come from Angola.</description>

      <description>Open source has its own tradition when fall starts cooling the atmosphere around, Hacktoberfest! Beer is not flowing like water but code is, and it creates more value than any bunch of slightly tipsy people. ;-)
Curated by the American cloud hosting company DigitalOcean, with Intel and DEV, Hacktoberfest happens online every year in October to celebrate open source. Itâ€™s pretty simple: for one month, people are encouraged to engage and create at least 4 pull requests for open source projects on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Contribution is not only about code. As an open source project, everyone is encouraged to participate in the construction of PrestaShop: you can translate the software in your native language, suggest a new feature, sign up to the User Club and share your experience with the product teams, become an ambassador&amp;hellip; and also write specifications!
Hosted on a dedicated GitHub repository, product specifications are meant to formally describe how features should work on a given page.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, the PrestaShop product team decided to use new leverage to help new contributors participate in the PrestaShop project on GitHub: the &amp;lsquo;good first issue&amp;rsquo; label.
But what is it exactly? And how does it work? Below are some questions raised to give it a proper definition and specify its use:
ðŸ¤” What does this label mean? People participating in the PrestaShop project do not have the same purpose, they also do not share the same skills.</description>

      <description>No need to repeat it: PrestaShop is an international solution. We aim at providing highly global features for worldwide users, and it means providing many useful localization packs containing correct and up-to-date information.
A localization pack is a file providing, for a given country, basic local information such as currencies, states, taxes, languages, measure units, etc. Since the first 1.7.0 release in 2016, those packs have never been cleaned nor updated.</description>

      <description>It is always great to see contributions from our community merged, it reminds the power of working on an open-source project. Especially when there are great features at stake, like the fuzzy search.
In this case, we are talking about the Levenshtein algorithm. It should be available in version 1.7.7 thanks to Lathanao and it will definitely improve both the user experience and the conversion rate on your site! Wow, but what is it?</description>

Indeed, a bug prevented email translation&amp;hellip; which was quite annoying, sorry for this quick inconvenience.</description>
