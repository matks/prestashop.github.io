      <description>A small line might have gone unnoticed in the PrestaShop 1.7.2.2 release announcement: &amp;ldquo;1.7 front-end should now be faster than 1.6’s for popular stores&amp;rdquo;. What does it apply to, and how did we test for such performances? Here&amp;rsquo;s how.
With the release of PrestaShop 1.7.2.2, we have tried to remove a few point of contention which were affecting badly overall PrestaShop performance:

      <description>A lot of things have been improved on PrestaShop 1.6.1.0:

Let’s now dig into the optimizations we have put in place, and do some benchmarks.
