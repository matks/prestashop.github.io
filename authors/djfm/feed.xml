      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to create a PrestaShop theme from scratch, you might have noticed it requires quite a large skillset: not only must you know HTML, CSS and Smarty, but you also need to be very familiar with the inner workings of PrestaShop itself.

      <description>With the release of PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 we are going to introduce exciting new tools in the codebase that are designed to help write more modular, testable code that enforces separation of concerns.
We are releasing our work on the software architecture of PrestaShop to start discussing it with our community, gather ideas and feedback, and improve it together.
Since we are introducing many new concepts we felt a few explanations were in order.</description>
